I helped in this project because i know that what we are creating has a group will be useful and helpful for people who likes or loves to read. In this project I did the "Why Should You Read?" section and basically what this section does is that it gives you some good reasons why reading is important. </div>

  <div class="desc"><h3>Jennifer Torres</h3>My name is Jennifer Torres and I'm 16. I am a junior at J. Sterling Morton East High School. I helped in this project because I think more kids our age should read more and not be too focused on social media. I did the "What's Trending?" page. I did some research and got the top 5 books, genres, and authors that may interest kids now a days. It gives you a small background on them and the books. </div>

I helped create this website because a lot of teens our age don't read anymore.
